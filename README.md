# Purpose of project

Creation of a remote information collection system for monitoring the state of the apiary.

# Project task
  * Creating a system of end devices and ensuring their data exchange with the base station;
  * Setting up cloud storage, developing software for the base station to work with the cloud;
  * Development of custom software for displaying recorded data;
  * Testing of the developed system in the field.

# The future of the project
  * Timely harvesting (using load cells); 
  * Hive safety (using GPS and accelerometer); 
  * Swarm population dynamics (using sound sensors, heat sensors, and machine learning methods);
  * Review existing solutions, energy consumption for the season, and calculate the project cost.

## Model of integration of the system with the hive body
